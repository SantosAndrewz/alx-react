0x00. Webpack

Webpack is a powerful tool for managing and bundling files in JavaScript projects.

Core Concepts:

Entry Point: It is the starting file of your application where webpack begins reading and analyzing your project, then looks for any imported modules.

Output: After combining everything it reads from the entry point, it produces an output bundle.

Loaders: These translate files written in other languages other than JavaScript.

Plugins: These provide add extra capabilities to Webpack. These may include managing environment variables or setting up a live server for development.

Dev Server: It enables local testing of the application.
